### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Located in Brisbane with a young family. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on many projects working out the best way to implement and improve DevOps both internally and for external clients. Current tooling stack includes:
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
  - [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/?cdn=disable)
  - [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.2)
  - [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com)
  - [GitHub](https://www.github.com)
- ðŸŒ± Currently skilling up  in Microsoft Azure again, focusing on DevOps and Data resources.
